# NecroTempus: Advanced Integration for Minecraft 1.7.10

Welcome to Crucible NecroTempus, a meticulously developed mod designed to bring the latest and most exciting features from newer Minecraft versions to the beloved 1.7.10 edition. This mod fosters seamless synergy between the Crucible server and the player's client-side experience.

## **How It Works:**

### On the Server:
- We've implemented interfaces based on the new Bukkit API foundations.
- By integrating NecroTempus into your server, the mod takes the reins, rewriting, and implementing feature codes.
- NecroTempus centralizes all API calls and oversees packet transmission.

### On the Client:
- NecroTempus loads and configures all essential GUIs and packets for efficient processing.
- When receiving packets from the server, the mod executes corresponding actions accurately.

## **Key Features:**

- **Advanced Detection System:**
   Know when you're connected to a pure Crucible server or one enhanced with NecroTempus.

- **Enhanced BossBar:**
   Elevate the BossBar experience to new heights, allowing seamless integration with mods and advanced customization.

- **Titles and Action Bar:**
   Enjoy impactful titles and informative action bars to enhance player communication.

- **Custom PlayerList:**
   Transform the player list into something unique by adding titles, and footers, and even displaying the player's head next to their names.

We're excited to bring a modern touch to the beloved Minecraft version 1.7.10, delivering a feature-rich experience and advanced integrations. Explore Crucible NecroTempus and take your Minecraft journey to an entirely new level.
